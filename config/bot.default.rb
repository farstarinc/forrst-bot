# This file can be used to set various configuration options for the bot without
# having to set them in the command line over and over again. Setting options
# works as following:
#
#     ForrstBot::Options[:nick] = 'forrst-bot'
#
# All options set in ForrstBot::Options will be copied over to Cinch so have a
# look at the following page for all available options:
#
# https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch/blob/master/lib/cinch/bot_configuration.rb
#

# ForrstBot::Options[:nick]     = 'forrst-bot'
# ForrstBot::Options[:password] = '...'
